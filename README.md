# SPokefy-project
Project inicialized to learn how use Django, including APIs and Bootstrap, from zero.


The project consist in use spotifyAPI and PokeAPI to create a new playlist at user's spotify, based on the pokemon team they choose. All the tracks are recommended by taking the pokemon type with a music genre, which have a generic relations defined by me. 

At the moment, the project is working pretty well in localhost, but it's needed apply more robusted to the application. With more exceptions treatment and security.
